## A Minecraft Forge mod, improving on Minecraft's Arsenal with Bone-Based Weapons, as well as adding some new decorations!

### ⚠️ Currently, this mod is only available for 1.12.2. I may end up porting it to fabric 1.19.2 and fabric 1.20.1, as I will not be learning how to mod newer versions of forge. ⚠️
This mod adds a bone scythe, bone anchor, fossils, sharp bones, bone infused diamond armor, and cosmetics.
